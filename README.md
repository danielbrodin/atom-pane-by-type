# Pane By Type

Open new files in a pane that contains the same type of file.

It works by looking at each pane and the items it has, and if it has an item
with the same extension it will open the file in that pane.

## TODO
Things that will or could perhaps be done
- [ ] Add pane layouts with predefined types?
- [ ] Base types on more than file extension?
